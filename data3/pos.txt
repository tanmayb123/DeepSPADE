You're right.  Auditing is another good use in some circumstances.

My new generator depends entirely on SQL Server's Implementation of UPPER and LOWER along with the fact that there are 255 ASCII characters.  For UNICODE you need to use unicode functions and the unicode upper limit (maybe not practical)...but here the ascii chars shouldn't change mostly.

"Thanks. That's a great way of explaining what refactoring is doing, but it doesn't go so far as to teach the actions of refactoring and the practices therein."
At my University (Canada) it was the way they show us why refactoring is important and how to develop ability with by comparing to those smells.
"this should be deleted, I don't see how it is adding anything - Kyralessa already answered this."
The approach you describe at the start breaks the MVC pattern in my mind. I go from having an action that does one thing cleanly to an action that does lots of different things in a hidden way. Your last point is interesting - maybe I shouldn't be using restful routes at all?
"@orlandu63: strictly speaking, both should be applied. First rawurlencode() to convert from text to text-in-URL, and then htmlspecialchars() to convert from URL to URL-in-HTML.  In practice first escaping makes second unneccessary, but it doesn't mean that htmlspecialchars() shouldn't be used."
Yes. It's an important part of learning refactoring (hence the up vote).
"@Vordreller - If you use the same form, the upload would still go through before the POST gets processed. Not a good solution."
"Unfortunately, this still doesn't work since the Cancel() method never gets called.  My best guess is that Invoke() on an event fires it on the thread it originated from so it is still being blocked by the ManualResetEvents"
"Turns out that offsetParent will not always work very well...it doesn't always get back to the Document itself, whereas traversing up the tree with parentNode will, if the node is part of the DOM tree; else it ultimately returns null. Not all paths up the tree with offsetParent work like this."
"The size that's actually shown depends on user settings and context.  Consider the ""Views"" menu on Explorer in Vista."
"In my experience, the DefaultButton property doesn't work outside of IE"
I tried this method and received the error: 'column does not allow nulls'.
"The reason i down voted your response is not because it was a bad solution, but because I asked explicitly for a lambda/phoenix solution."
I think the point is that a tree is only balanced if all subtrees in it are.
I would suggest using a lookup table for future expansion reasons. Inserting another row into a table is a lot easier than figuring out how to redo the constraint.
"Stroustrup often talks about variables stored in ROM.  As does the C++ Standards committee ( http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/PDTR18015.pdf pg. 75).  In reality, it's not physical ROM, but instead a section of the executable for data (in ELF it's the .text section)."
"Thanks, but I was looking for a way of not diving into the spring source... Anyway the PDF does not mention the internals of spring."
"Also, the question title could be significantly improved"
"Upon further investigation, that may just be when the button is a LinkButton that it doesn't work outside IE..."
"Also, offsetParent isn't part of the DOM spec, apparently: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Element.offsetParent What's more, it ""returns null when the element has style.display set to 'none'"" which would screw things up a bit for me."
"This occurs on a brand new project, so the references are the standard ones initially applied."
"Actually, no I was not aware of GetLastInputInfo. But given that usually when we do these sorts of hooks, we are not just looking for timeout information, that call alone would not be useful for us. We are usually hooking for a broader range of key and mouse handling functionality."
"@Tal, as others have said, as stated the question is kind of vague.  Maybe you want to look at people's comments and see if you can ask a little more specific question."

"A disconnected recordset is a device used in Access usually in place of temp tables, where you make a recordset, and then cancel it's ActiveConnection.  It's complicated, but can be used where one would need a temporary table.  I'm not familiar enough to give all details, you'll need to Google it."
Surely someone has an idea.
"I'm getting ""Gödel, Escher, Bach""-vibes."
"Actually, they were right, in some circumstances. Banning seems a bit over the top though.   Take for example, the line :  a[i] = i++;  i may get incremented before it is used to index a, or after. The language does not define this."
Of course this assumes you are the author and/or have source. If this becomes a part of ones programming practice you run the risk of not thinking about this possibility.
"Yes, I'm invoking YAGNI in this case. :-)"

"Thanks, presumably the variable you've named configuration is the bean I've named freemarkerConfiguration?"
"Shouldn't the first ""productCode"" be the name of the constraint instead of the name of the column?"
"My phrasing may have been poor.  I did not mean that Dreamweaver was ""the best"".  I meant to say that I know Dreamweaver will work with those technologies.  I was not sure of Dreamweaver's use of ruby, asp, etc.  Certainly with ASP, the best choice would be a Microsoft product such as VS2008."
I would add that DreamWeaver has a code pane that allows you to ignore the WYSIWYG editor and edit the raw HTML/CSS/Javascript with code highlighting.
"And if any of your business logic changes that might require that the table in question get updated by a different mechanism, you probably need to retool your transaction object.  Maybe that's a good thing in your case.  I don't use triggers often myself.  I am, however, glad that I have the option."
I agree with Outlaw - WTF? Silly response.
"Ah yes, of course.  Let me revise the question."
"No, it's not an editor :-)  Editors are just an easy way of explaining the concept."

Interesting Wikipedia article. Has anyone noticed that it's always management that decides on this approach? I know of no examples where developers have voluntarily put up their hands to try this.
That's interesting.
"The second bit applies to any language that has a ""comment to end of line"" marker.  That includes C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, VB, etc., etc."

"I'm surprised this one is voted up so much considering it's wrong. As people have pointed out, it will not work for all palindromes, specifically with punctuation etc. The wisdom of crowds eh.."
Cool. I had always assumed that a constraint can't have the same name as a column in the same table.
"Oracle, yes.  Mysql - I think not.  Mysql seems to want to place a constraint on the column instead of checking the validity of a row."

I am using SqlDataAdapters. I've updated the question to make that clear. :)
Let's say there would be a nasty bug that allowed you to make injection to a parameterized query. you wouldn't be able to send the injection to the procedure because it is precompiled.
"Actually, we'll be using the data context method.  Kind of sucks, but it gets the job done and we only have one entity with an XML column.  Should be easy to keep clean and organized."

"The comment below has a point.  Thsi is tabular data, why not use tables?"

When you are making your library don't forget that at least a couple of the things on this list vary based on locale.
"This trick does not work according to the standard.  It attempts to create a comment marker through the preprocessor, but comments are to be removed before the preprocessor runs.  A conforming compiler will cause a syntax error here."
"Few bytes?  For many environments (ASCII only data), Java's storage requirements are slightly more than double the required amount.  For large volumes of data, this is indeed a large block of wasted memory."
"I imagine there are various ways of doing this, but now the question I have is; which is best?"
This isn't a third party tool. It's published by Microsoft.
"Ok, so I don't know that name of my own CodePlex project ;-)  I'll fix it. Anthony (below) also posted the correct link."
"If the compiler refuses your request to inline, it might have a very good reason.  A good compiler will be better at inlining properly than you are, and a bad one will give you more performance problems than this."
"As I wrote, in most cases no. But yes, I have written more than one app, where the biggest part of the heap were String instances and the corresponding char[]. The few bytes are several hundreds of MB."
How are you using the build? Are you using msbuild or calling devenv from the command line or are you building this right in the IDE?
"Good point, EBGreen. Thanks."
"Also note that the only reason i needed the element number was because I had explicitly resized the container, otherwise I could have used an inserter(which i eventually did)"
"Is it more dangerous than the typical internet?  I've heard that people that use free wifi in hotels and coffee shops can just watch the emails passwords from others in the vicinity.  However, I cannot see my neighbors emails from my house.  THis office situation is more like the free wifi?"
"Which VB do you want an answer for? VB.Net, VB6, VBA, or VBScript?"
"This is definitely a programming related question. There are many scenarios where this problem would crop up during development, such as when testing installers or plugins. Just because the question isn't framed as a programming scenario doesn't mean it's not a legit SO question."
"@DGB, Darryl's 'something else' from from the original question's example. The question has nothing to do with dynamically assembling queries, it has to do with iterating over the results of a query. Which he answered correctly. Though I agree that Shabbyrobe gave a *better* answer."
Why fake a definition list when one exists?
"Additionally, if you want 2 columns, use 2 definition lists, and float them."
"It would be worth changing the example - if you specify a base class name, that has to come before any interfaces. And you meant ""new()"" instead of ""New()""."
"Still not good for ""processing files that are larger than RAM"", but if it's good enough for you, great."
"SGI isn't exactly the ""source"".  It is based on the original (HP?) STL, but the Standard deviated from that.  SGI's merely says what their implementation does, not what the Standard says it's supposed to do."
"You could always do it old-school, back in the day before string. Arrays of char. much more efficient. Look at some C++ implementations of arrays of char.

That's the ticket!
"I think you mean SQL-89 and SQL-92, not ANSI-82 and ANSI-92."
"Zip only works on Strings bigger than some hundreds chars. I did Huffman coding with static lookups once - that worked. But this means, we store the data in byte[] again.   Unfortunately the javolution classes are not memory efficient, as a Google code search showed - you were right."
"I dunno about evil, but it is certainly proprietary to Sybase and Microsoft SQL Server, and not supported by other brands of database."
good question.  Definition lists would be more appropriate here.  I will update to make note of that.
We will each have our own locking office (though cleaning staff has access).  I know there's inherent danger in accessing unencrypted sites over the internet but it's even worse in a public wifi hotspot.  Can I make our offices at least as secure as accessing the internet from home?
"I don't see how the second and third paragraphs follow the first, which claims that what you're locking on isn't important."
That's a great idea to ask about.
Much nicer than my answer. :)
"While it's true it can be viewed as tabular data, the visual display (2 sets of key=>value pairs) makes it awkward in terms of accessibility if it were a table. You can also view it as a list of keys and values that happens to be displayed in 2 columns... so using CSS to position is also a solution."
how do you clear the stringstream?
"Good distinction, Javier.  Thanks for the clarification!"
MySQL does not support CHECK constraints.  They can do something similar with their proprietary ENUM data type.
"The free wifi is dangerous. as is wifi in your house. I use my neighbor's wifi by accident whenever my laptop decides that signal is stronger. Even the secured wireless networks are pretty vulnerable. I treat my home network as hostile, just like the starbucks network."

"I agree, James.  The one I can think of is MIPS, which only has less-than.  So the compiler usually rearranges ""a <= b"" to ""not (b < a)"".  The only case where that doesn't work is when one is a NON-ZERO constant..."

"Using the DEFAULT keyword indicates that you wish the database to use the default value for that field. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174335(SQL.90).aspx. When I tested this, it did insert the default value for the column when no parameter was provided to the proc."

What I'm trying to accomplish is to build a visual application that monitors some tables and shows the operator when the last record was inserted on each of a certain set of tables.
"In this particular case, I think linking to the distribution is more appropriate, because there are a huge number of modules within it, as well as a tutorial."
You really only need one bit per number to implement that algorithm.
Yeah it threw me off that the redists didn't work but copying the folders from the compiler redist into the application folder worked fine.  The deployment machines have 3.5 and the app is 3.5 but the library is compiled againts 2.0 (same CLR).  I'm sure there is something obvious i'm overlooking.
"This is a very interesting approach to solving my problem. I'm not sure whether I'll utilize it because of the overhead it would add to my project, but I like that the information would be driven by the data sets."

That sounds interesting. I would like more details about what MSIE6 base install does and does not with respect to XSLT. If only to explain why people should be using Firefox to enjoy my uber-cool XSLT hacks.

"@xtoff - this doesn't apply to string. In order to allow support for reference counted strings, calling any non-const member function (except a few that do nothing but return references or iterators) may invalidate any existing iterators."

There are many problems with this code.  You can't just call vector::reserve() and then start manipulating pointers and depending on magic implementation details like powers of two.

"It does matter, because if it's stateful, you might use a different approach than the partial DTO thing and that's what I was going to explore.  And it doesn't matter whether the DTO completely describes it, it doesn't need to."
"Thanks. I pretty much know at this point that the string is not empty or ""*"", but I agree that it would be better to code it that way just in case something changes later."
I just hate having to add and maintain lots action names in my routes file manually. If I wasn't using REST then I wouldn't need to do it. Is there a cleaner way? If not then this it is.
Beware of optimizing above the repository level because you're allowing DB optimization thinking to leak through the repository abstraction. You can apply 2nd level caching or other such techniques later if performance becomes an issue
"While I haven't had any issues upgrading projects, I can appreciate how awkward the code base might be if 25% had v3.5 things things and the other 75% didn't."
"Yes, zip won't work for that reason (headers too big)... but I think gzip crosses over at smaller values, albeit probably still in the 100+ char range.  It is kind of surprising that noone has developed one with memory efficiency as the primary goal."
"Technically speaking, no: an AIR app can't modify its own application directory. AIR apps have a local storage folder for saving data, but again, that's a separate security domain."
"Nope, that's perfectly legal C++ code. The STL guarantees that this will work: vector will allocate consecutive space for at least 2^n elements. After all 2^n elements vector is allowed to realloc, giving you a new space behind vector::begin(). Sorry, it might be hacky, but it's the standard. :-)"
You know I tagged it non-programming and for the time being I'm sticking by that. Does MySpace have an API? Were you asking how to do this programmatically?
"This is probably the best way to do it, unfortunately you cannot combine COALESCE and DEFAULT to remove the IF."
"Yes, definitely. That's why I didn't phrase my answer in absolutes, saying things like ""you might want to think about"" and ""usually end up running into problems"" instead."
I think he is looking for CSS techniques
"If we're looking for clarity - why not just numbers.AddRange(new int[] { 10, ..., 1 }? Or, for that matter numbers = new ArrayList(new int[] { 10, ..., 1 })."
"But yeah, I totally agree about the bad karma thing. The flash security model has been devised by very smart people to enforce a collection of best practices so it is a bit silly to swim against the tide. In my defense, the external domain is ""trusted"" (w. airquotes) but that's not really the point."
Heh...that appears to be the way it works. I just answered to simply express my opinion. I didn't expect this response at all.
I was asking how to do this through CSS code.
haha that's cool... I havn't thought of that.. stupid me.
"darcs has had ""trackdown"" since before git existed.  The early versions were pretty rough, admittedly."
"I see the downvotes, but insist that there exist good reasons for using this STL property (it's there for a reason). Hey, there are a lot of doctoral theses out there that use this property :)"
As per your request - I'm a CE (computer engineer) that prefers the hardware/firmware side of development but is comfortable across the range - see my stackoverflow and/or linkedin profile.
"You can partition off an internal section as this answer suggests. I wouldn't use FTP to anything outside of your internal partition. ssh tunnels to any servers is probably a good solution, or you could set up a VPN."
"Sorry, how, exactly is: ""X* p = v.begin();"" standard?  How is using operator[] to access out of bounds elements in a vector standard?  What is special about pointers that makes this work over (say) integers?  Where does this code even compile?"
re Forwards that work across units.  This is not really a problem that can't be corrected using interfaces..they work well and aren't just good for COM development.
"Date comparisons are usually tricker than that as datetime fields store the time down to (at least) the second.  If you're storing the dates as strings, this wouldn't apply."
"Thanks a lot, Tim, and Craig too. It seems to be the best way to wait for the final release and not playing around with this hacks, which alle seem to be not perfect at all today. Maybe I should use WebForms again until ASP.NET MVC is 100% ready :-(."
Ah... indeed but actually the precision of values wouldn't be a problem in my case but a BETWEEN query would still require typing the 4 fields explicitly?
My Delphi 2006 IDE is so bad that it's silly. The people responsible should be ashamed.
"Janm, the STL defines this behaviour as standard behaviour, like it or not. Go ahead and try on your C compiler (incl missing asterisk :). It is useful if you want the power of std::vector and need the data pointed to consecutively, such as when sending vertex data to a graphics card."
"In that case, tag removed"
"When I tried to install meld, I got some major errors on the dependencies. Next I installed the dependencies manually. This approach worked... port deactivate intltool port install intltool port install python25 port install py25-gtk port install py25-gnome port install rarian port install meld"
Can you be a bit more specific?  Are you adding these as a server object through code-behind or through javascript?
"I'm the current maintainer of File::Path, it was dual-lifed on CPAN in the run up to 5.10"
"EvilTeach, it looks like it was dfloat (55 mantissa bits)."
Any more examples of ciphertext-plaintext pairs?
If you wrap your resources in objects that can be collected then GC can handle resource management too. If you back this up with a disposable pattern then you can free resources you know you are finished with.
"Some databases have multiple data types for date/time. According to doc, there is no high-precision date datatype in MySQL :( You only easy choice is to map datetime as time in milliseconds to long. If you create a custom type, even the conversion will be automatic."
"I would tell you the name, but I've just finished a very hard programming task"
"Just tried on VC2005 and gcc 3.4.6.  Failed, first error on ""X** p = v.begin();""  You have to change it to ""X** p = &v[0];"" to even get it to compile.  It is still broken; what do you expect v.size() to return?"
I was going to just write 'n' but it doesn't allow short answers
That's nice and small.  A byte array is fine.
"Yes, thank you. I do know about those functions and you're probably right, I should be smarter and use them. Since I have no control over the file, I can only watch the file's size, but to be fair, I don't poll it continuously (only once a second)."
"Would that then be a model _T (which, btw, turned 100 this month) ? <gdr>."
@Nick - It crashes so much and has eaten so much of my work that I trust MS more than I trust the Delphi IDE. 2009 is better but not much.  I am seriously down to editing code in VIM and compiling via NANT for everything but debugging
Sorry but sp_addmergearticle will not work in this case if @force_reinit_subscription is set to false. Reinitialising replication is then mandatory.

"That's a true concern. However, a good programmer will learn to handle a capistrano makefile in less than a day. Trust me. For example, I don't do any Ruby usually and I've coded tasks with namespaces in less than eight hours. The docs for capistrano are pretty awesome."
Ah that n INT REFERENCES is new to me. Is it supported on other platforms as well?... and please consider that normalization has its cost in terms of speed and complexity as well.
it seems reasonable that OS and common runtime libraries define types with genericish names; but shouldn't your company's types also be prepended with a prefix or something?
"Sorry Luis my first response was very flippant. It will be driven by the nature of your data. The relationaships of your data will drive the model you use to represent the data. Then the collection *should* be apparent from that. If not, I would worry about the data model."
"I tried this with defaultdict, but it's still not returning None for underfined:   <pre> >>> d = AttrDict() >>> d.me Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module> KeyError: 'me' </pre>"
Would you please provide a code snippet on how to use groupTableViewBackgroundColor? Thanks!
"Sometimes I think it is because I wrote the code rather than called current popular API, which as you said, does the exact same thing."
"Well, if you're ending up with a NON-Flash page as a result, you are better of putting a hidden form on your parent HTML page and populating the form with JavaScript, which you can call from Flash,  and submitting it."
The solution for me was to create a base page and register the javascript.
this helped me in the right direction. I needed to just use the httpssession and upgrade my version of hamcrest.
Objects stored in Session are only serialized with the Binary serializer if they are stored out-of-process (e.g. stored in SQL Server).
"REFERENCES is a part of standard SQL, and should be supported by every database that supports foreign keys."
Interesting hack. I'll see if that works.
"Normalization does come with some costs, but are they more or less costly than the gymnastics required by a denormalized design?  Your original problem is a case in point.  It's best to start with a normalized design, and denormalize sparingly."
Your image-fu is strong.
">There really aren't any true ""private"" attributes or methods in Python. That is why I didn't ask how to make them private, but how to 'remove' them from the interface. Hope that the edited version is more accurate"
I'm a big fan of Source Insight too. Excellent editor with awesome symbol lookup functions.
"Knowing the address of the violation could be useful.  It's possible ""this"" is null and it has nothing to do with the map itself."
"I stand by my statement. look at the ""knarly typedef"" in Martin York's post. There's no way you can replace myfunc with boost::function and get it to work."
That won't work for a const vector though.
"Also, the second to last number should be 39916800, not 3991800 (this may illustrate a problem with look up tables)."
"Ah, so that's how the other methods do it... Thanks, this is definitely the closest, and even looks like it could be extracted out to be a module and/or plugin."
"The sleep is commented out. I put that, there, to see if i could send an email. when the sleep is UNCOMMENTED, then the background worker thread code is executed. when the code is comented out, then the background worker thread code is never executed.  I'll try using ThreadPool instead."
"Your letterOccurrances() function will also count whitespace and punctuation, perhaps not intentionally."
"The to_string has no default specification in this case, but your latter answer works! Thanks."
"Ok, so how do you compress that data before storing it into SQL server?"
"hehe...You are so right Tomalak. I haven't done any programming for 25 years when I could do anything in Sinclair ZX81 basic!! However, I am getting the hang of it. I figured this problem out, thanks for all your help and Bill, Cheers. Have a look at my code. It's works perfectly, any flaws guys?"
"Wow, the lengths we go to to get by security!"
In the prototype pattern properties inherit from the parent object. So until I define a position for AwesomeDragonImmuneToFire it inherits the position of AwesomeDragon.
"Note that the writing thread hasn't started filling it at all yet. It throws on the first line of operator[]. As far as I know, lower_bound doesn't change the contents of the map."
"I can't. I didn't know it was not in the standard. I checked on Windows, Linux, and Mac and it was in all three, so I figured it was everywhere important. :-)"
... Share privately? =)
"Yes, I was mocking the app up thats why I left the NotImplementedException in there. In any case, it never gets thrown since the ProgressChanged event never fires. But you've given me something to work with at least...thanks!"
"You mean the map's this pointer? The map is static, and it is never changed outside of the for loop."
"oooh, the string formatting inside SQL makes me angry! Especially the <br>, no danger of MVC here! :) With that off my chest, you could always wrap the CONCATed string with a REPLACE(X, '<br> ($0.00)', '') if you can't figure anything else out."
That did it. Thanks.
"What are the other threads doing, are any others accessing this shared variable also? I don't recall if the code inserted by the compiler for static variables is thread safe itself."
Hahaha. Well sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. And that does the trick. :)
"As written, your question is impossible to answer. Trim it down to the bare essentials"
"Yeah, but it won't compile if you actually call the function and evaluate the template parameters."
I have to vote here too.  IT is internationally safe and uses someone else's library which is probably full of all sorts of checks.  YOu can't go wrong here :)
"Yes, that's what it looks like.  But I agree that makes no sense if the only access of the map is mappedChars[c].  The iterator could be what's null caused by the race conditions - an iterator returned, the map updated by another thread making it invalid."
"Yes, they should.  Unfortunately, I wasn't in charge of the naming convention at the time when it was used.  And global search and replace isn't something that's sanctioned - though it could be used to fix a lot of problems, even in a monstrous code base."
"Ah, but how do you *know* the ProgressChanged event never fires?  His point is that the NotImplementedException might well be thrown, but ignored.  Add a Debug.Print in there and see if you see it."
"yes this code isn't something going into production, just something i whipped up real quick"
Don't forget ContainerBuilderFactory and IBuiltContainer

"I was actually looking for a way to make the mathematical way of doing it faster than the String comparison, if such a way existed.  As I said this has become more of a personal challenge on my own time and has gone away from what the project actually requires."
"Yes, well done. LOL! Just because, in my day job, I endlessly come across huge methods full of undocumented code called things like `findMatch` I'm totally unqualified to post a little (friendly) general advice. Oh and thanks for putting some suggestions in my mouth too!"

"This is the correct approach unless you are looking for very accurate and repeatable print layouts, like forms or anywhere you need to align the results.

I use _type instead of _t on my typedefs precisely to avoid that.
"If the data is tabular, the export to Excel option is excellent. No matter how you present your data, someone else will want to slice, dice, color code, and graph something from it - letting them download Excel (or just CSV) allows for all of that."

Html Agility Pack is awesome
I think I answered the question as asked (same as with your JNI/Mock question BTW... ahem).  Maybe this is a new question.
See this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37162/how-do-i-make-an-html-page-print-in-landscape-when-the-user-selects-print
"Ditto - I was actually about to recommend using HTML Tidy to get the document into good shape and then turn it into an XmlDocument, but perhaps you can skip that with the HTML Agility Pack. Good stuff."
"that's actually a really good point, and it does optimize it quite a bit.  nice catch!"
"Form parameters are no safer than query string parameters in this respect.  Anyone who can induce someone to issue a GET can also induce them to issue a POST.  You need to use things like encrypted cookies, validation elements, etc. to make sure requests are coming from your pages."
"this solution works the same as mine, but is obviously much better!"
"running more tests, this is great for cases where b is fairly large.  when b is large, the string method takes the same amount of time whereas the math one beats it by a landslide!"

"Why are you limiting the range to 10000? If you increase the limit to even eg 20000 then duplication is not a big deal. (I assume you're checking that the ""random"" ID is not in use already -- if nothing else as a safety measure!)"
A pick list is a kind of search dialog optimized to get the data you want quickly.  Browsing through over a thousand record is really not effective.
"I'm pretty sure I could manage, but I've been given a different direction from my manager. So, I don't get to try it out. From my experience, though, I'm sure that would have worked. Thanks for your help."
"Gabr, your threading library looks fantastic - thanks for pointing it out.  Oh, and I'd say your site is ""spartan"", not ugly."

The good news is that if they go down the Mac cross-compiling road then it would seem Linux would be simple to include as well.
Just pointing out that your code assigns -1 to an (apparently) unsigned type (foo_struct.A = -1;). Probably not the right thing to be doing.
"Most all of that is in Delphi 2009, and it is really well done.  Check it out."
"Absolute introduces an alias, a different name (and possibly type) for the same location."
I agree with point 3. sysinternals handle.exe is invaluable as a command line tool to analyse this sort of problem.
"Could well be a smell in the example I provided, I did come up with it off the cuff...  a more likely example might be something like an IExtendedLoggerFactory which extends ILoggerFactory and is implemented by a single class which satisfies both interfaces."

Oh i was getting all sort of funny error from that one.  ValueError: too many values to unpack
unfortunately the fix for this issue ended up being a shift to a new company - the phone is the single worst device for developers.  i like when internal folks just come and see you (they can tell if your working and should come back later)

"@Dave Marshall: You logic is backwards. exists() will return 0 if the file can be opened, otherwise 1. Based on the function name I'd expect it to be the other way around."
A perfect answer! Thank you.
"IE 6 stinks, by the way - I am dealing with major issues with it right now because we have to support it as well as IE 7. Barf!"
that is good to know.  I've only ever seen signal handlers used to close things neatly before exiting so I wouldn't usually be relying on behaviour to do with reinstalling the handler.

Wouldn't tail -f only output new data when it saw a newline in the binary file? I doubt it unbuffers its stdout.
"Thanks. Your point is correct. In my case, we are usually contracted to cover very particular needs/implementation so, reuse of the code that is particular to a client’s need is usually not possible for other clients. Which IS reused in any case are our own libraries."
"Thank you Brian!I convert the c#code into c++, it works!. BTW my English Name is also Brian *_*"
Thanks BoltBait. This is a very good point. What we do is to release to the client the part that is particular to their solution. The rest (if a general routine is required) is implemented as part of our libraries.
I like the use of direct probability over choosing randomly from a list of lines.
"There is a tradeoff here because your method will favour lines that are longer over shorter lines. Mark Ransom's solution doesn't have this problem, but it needs to read the entire file (but not all at once)."

"this doesn't have anything to do with register globals. Setting the php_flag via .htaccess isn't ""runtime"" either, i thought."
This is a good choice for operating within the limited resources of the DS (or any such device).

"Thanks for that Scott, at the minute we are planning on just allowing concatenation of pdf (although doing it with HTML would be good too), if the TOC is out that is fine for now, as most of our clients just want to print out reports to take to board meetings etc, not a major issue."

"I want the file to be easily editable in a text editor, so updating a header each time the file is edited would take too long."
We leverage common code by retaining non specific-client's-need-code in our libraries. Usually what we put into our libraries in any particular project is dim. This might have to do with the fact we use to do very specific solutions.
Thank you! Turns out this is actually a problem with flora. I'll Edit the question to reflect it.
"I upvoted the answer because I think in theory it's right. However, integer overflow does cause the end result to be skewed."
His solution is not good if you have to keep generating random lines.  A lot of extra reading that you won't need.
We provide them with their's solution source code and our's libraries binaries. That is what is included with the development-project price. Source Code for our libraries can be negotiated at a separate contract/license and price.
That's correct petebob. The other way works great for us. Helps to gain confidence with the client. In general we are called again when new projects with the same code or other code are required.
"but who writes a system where the stored procedures only perform queries? what do you do for updates - or update side-effects (without triggers, which of course still suck ;-))"
"1st line: 50% chance.  2nd line: (100-50%)*(1/3)=16.7%, 3rd line: (100-50-16.7%)*(1/4)=8.3%, ... This is a valid distribution, but it isn't all uniform (and the OP didn't say it had to be uniform)."
"It took a couple of tries but you finally came up with a decent answer so I reversed my downvote.  I have solved this same problem before using both your method and Mark's, they are both fine solutions, which is best depends on the situation."
just be careful that rand() * count doesn't cause an overflow for larger files (MAX_INT / RAND_MAX is the limit on the number of lines).
"And I recommend to use a good computer with it, not the old generation PC from the graveyard.  It make a big difference will creating the image and restoring it."
"In my experience, it works well across browsers for buttons."
"If you want a uniform distribution (even odds of picking any line), you need to do something like this.  Mark Random's is heavily biased to the first lines in the file (which may or may not be fine for the application)."
"Mark Random?  I don't think anybody's called me that before, but in this case it fits..."
What's the purpose of encrypting a column? Surely the smart thing to do would be to encrypt a row's sensitive data through your app and store a salt along with the row so that it's harder to decrypt.
I had random on the brain
What are the ownerships and permissions on the directory in which the file resides?
Your solution is not good it the content of the file is potentially changing - it's a tradeoff
"wow im an idiot, thats it, thx."
Nice. Why not just seek backwards though?
"Mark's and Adam's solutions each ""work"": they do sample from a random distribution. It just isn't a uniform distribution (which is probably what's desired). If all lines are of similar length, Adam's could be a good approximation."
"@Mr Fooz, Mark's solution (if I interpreted it correctly) is a well-known algorithm for this very problem and appears in TAoCP.  At first it might appear to be biased but when you work out the math you can see that this is not the case."
"1800 I guess you could make a copy if you knew it would be changing, but still needed a fair random distribution.  Or you could use some kind of file locking."
"actually with this method, you will get the first line of the file half the time!"
"There's surely something that I don't understand, If you have 1000 lines, the last line has a very low probability of being kept, but the first line still has 50%.  What am I missing?"
You can also use the -debug flag when invoking Ant to get some more information if -verbose isn't helpful enough.
"I'm going to put the seq1, seq2, etc. at the start rather than at the end of my field names so that the email records are only processed once and to avoid acceptions.  The way you have it, your if would run both for an email and a key."
I didn't select an answer because even though two of them helped neither of them is complete.
"Ahh... I know there are restrictions to an app modifying its app directory contents but I thought they were overridable. Given that, I don't know if your original aim is possible or not."
You are wrong! You are now allowed to run the program and see what happens (you still have to explain it.)
"What the heck is everybody talking about?  This solution **does** pick every line with equal probability, regardless of how many lines there are.  First line has a 1/1 chance of being picked, but an (n-1)/n chance of being replaced later on."
This Serverside article misses the point (again) like so many others. People who argue against stored procs (for most but not all situations) are not advocating moving sql from stored procs into a DAL. They are advocating removing the sql all together! How can that not be more maintainable.
"Well, not have to; just should. :-)"
Since SQL Server 7 queries have been cached.
"Thanks, that works, but I was hoping to find a way to keep it in /lib and am really curious as to why it won't work that way."
"tvan and Martin Cote - you are both wrong. See e.g., here for a detailed explanation of the math behind this answer http://www.unix.com.ua/orelly/perl/cookbook/ch08_07.htm"
yup... I was way sloppy. thanks!
"It appears to be ""Repair Move"" in TortoiseSVN 1.5.4, which I d/l'ed today, after reading this.  Thanks, this was extremely helpful."
"tvanoffsen - perhaps your misunderstanding is that it doesn't stop when it has ""picked"" a line - subsequent lines can replace it (with diminishing probability)"
I think this is one of the best answers I have heard. In enterprise land with lots of DBs and lots of applications talking to them you need to put up some walls. But if you are just building a single application with a database no one else will ever see then stored procs are often overkill.
"Oh I see now, for some reason when I was reading and re-reading the example it didn't occur to me that he didn't exit the loop once he had selected a match (nevermind there was no code there to even do that, I guess I was just seeing what wasn't there)."
Pointer to int vs pointer to array of 4 integers.
"""queries"" refers to insert, update, and delete et al as well."
This answer is wrong on so many points.
"Why would you want to catch all exceptions? Unless you can do something to either correct the problem or you are logging it (in which case you would re-throw it afterwards), you should let exceptions bubble up to the point in code where they can be taken care of."
"Says ""Aha"" and slaps head.  Sorry."
"This question should be ""so you think you know arrays""!  It all hinges on the type that &x returns for an array."
It's called Access XP only by end users who don't know the official app name that Microsoft used. It is Access 2002. There was never any product called Access XP by Microsoft.
Not using SPs does not mean you have to scatter SQL code throughout your app. That is an urban legend.
"That said, I do think such a tool would be useful, but not for the *exact* same purpose you mention."
"Agreed, ""..."" % locals() is much more Pythonic too, in that it's a common idiom."
A lot of the work is done already with the admin app - that's where a lot of the productivity is going to come from. I just need a way of enforcing who has access to what. See my update above for an example.
Pointer arithmetic doesn't work like straight arithmetic. Any addition is converted into the pointer size first.
"er oops i mean magic_quotes_gpc, which is ini_perdir (virtual host/php.ini), so .htaccess wouldn't work on that"
"Well that is just it, I have no idea what exceptions might bubble up.  I could catch Exception but what am I going to do with that?  Being explicit about exceptions makes you think more about what you're writing and where it could go wrong."
"Actually, the FPU difference replication errors can happen with innodb too, any table column that uses float or double.  The exact error you'll see (one in so many thousands of times,) is a column width difference error."
"i don't get it.  your bad experiece was because of the virtual server infrastructure, or because of Linux?  you plan to use EC2/Win because it's amazon, or because it's not linux?"
"I don't think this exact implementation would correctly sort ""aaa 3 aaa"" and ""aaa 12 aaa"", as they have different lengths and would thus be sorted as pure strings, not as numerically required."
"Yeah, if I saw that second piece of work in real code, I would be quite confused. But it does work differently, at least on this machine, so I suppose I should do a little boning up on the stuff."
Please clarify if the symlink itself is on a remote server (via UNC) or if it's the symlink target that's a UNC path.
"Pointer size, so that would be 32bit address = 4 bytes."
"Does VB6 have stored procedures? Does .NET have stored procedures? Access is a database application development platform. Jet is the default database engine, which is what intended to ask about. Jet lacks stored procedures (there's no server process to manage them so there couldn't possibly be)."
"A disconnected recordset is an ADO feature, not an ""Access"" feature. ADO is not the preferred interface to Jet data -- DAO is. And you can get the same ""temp table"" features by using transactions and simply not committing them."
"ok, I'm learning slowly.  This brings on my next question, what's the difference between ""include"" and ""require""?  I'll go do some reading, but how can methods be seen which were loaded via ""require""?"
"An array is not a pointer.  However, when you reference the array as shown, it becomes a pointer."
FileZilla doesn't support XCRC
Could you please explain that comment? It seems to me that James Marshall is clearly asking a question about Microsoft Access.
"Also, as the other answers show, the fourth value is 16 bytes 0x10 more than the first."
"Sounds right to me: &x is a pointer to int[4], not int. So adding 1 adds the size of int[4], which is 16 bytes."
"No; &x is a pointer to an array of 4 ints, so &x + 1 is 16 bytes later."
BuildCriteria is a really excellent tool. It's a programmatic interface to the same part of the expression service that parses what you type in the criteria line of the QBE into correct syntax. It's one of my most-often used non-obvious Access commands.
"your absolutely right Chris.  I had a height set for the link element which IE6 ignored but other browsers used to crop the borders.  I replaced the height:26 with a margin-bottom:-4 and this had the same effect, but worked in all browsers.  thanks for your help."
&x is a pointer to an array of ints.  x is a pointer to the first element in the array.
"thanks for fixing the formatting nickf, I didn't know how to type an anchor tag without having jeff's code strike it out."
"Also, the extra long navbar was fixed by floating the div for the rounded corner to the left.  Case closed"
"You're right, thanks. This explains one of the bugs I had :)"
"Adam's algorithm is fatally flawed, no matter what you try to do to accommodate for this you cannot overcome the fact that the initial position chosen is going to be skewed based on line length which destroys any possibility of a uniform distribution."
Don't you mean that Jet has the database open? I see nothing in your post that indicates that Access is being run at all.
I wonder who upvoted this answer.
"Yeah, I saw in the answer above that the &foo + 1 == &foo + sizeof(foo) -- which in the case of an array is the amount of space allocated to the array.  And, yeah, your first statement is correct too: an array's not a pointer but in many cases it's treated as one."
"I really like this solution, as it works if I change my mind on how the link should be later on (I might use a number somewhere else in the link on accident and wonder why my code was wrong.)"
"I did consider that, but was not able to verify whether the compiler would indeed take into consideration the array size or not. Is there some documentationo that explains this?"
"@Draemon - seeking backwards won't help, consider a file where line 1 is 98 bytes and lines 2 and 3 are both 1 byte.  You have a 98% chance of landing in line 1, no matter what you do from there you will have a 98% chance of hitting the same line every time you run the process."
Why do people answer a very clear question about a file-based db engine WITH front-end development tools with a suggestion of a database engine only?
umm...which would be a pointer...ergo....
"Craig, could you explain what you mean by ""They are advocating removing the sql all together. I could be missing the point too."
"Well, without the crlf settings, things function fine, but the merges panic about the line ending differences and show huge diffs even though the only delta has to do with whitespace.  I also tried whitespace = cr-at-eol, but that doesn't seem to help in this regard."

"Anyway, this could be an abandoned issue because the watir project is reportedly fully moving to git before the year end.  Thanks for your input nevertheless."
"""Any addition is converted into the pointer size first"" -- I know you meant ""size of the pointed-to object"" but some of the other posters here don't know you meant that.  ""Is there some documentationo"" -- C language definition 38 years ago, maybe some textbooks since then too."
"darn you people are fast... yes Brian, I was editing while you answered ;-)."
Explain how that would work across process boundaries.
You can also pass Django requests through nginx via FastCGI -- Apache is no longer a requirement.
It's sloppy but it's fast and that may be a reasonable tradeoff depending on the kind of data the OP is working with (eg. larger files with not too much variation in line length).
"Unless you intend to illustrate a program with undefined behavior, you should cast all of them to void *, as per my answer."
The answer is... don't use Stored Procedures.
If your database serves several applications then you probably need a service (WS/REST) layer.
"Sorry, I don't really have more of them :-("
thanks. its taken 40 minutes so far and is showing 0. its a 740mb database. fingers crossed i didnt break it
That applications shouldn't be connecting to the DB. They should be connecting to a service layer.
"Just some FYI -- popen2 is ""Deprecated since version 2.6: This module is obsolete. Use the subprocess module. Check especially the Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module section."""
"Kernighan & Ritchie, (first edition, 1978), page 93, section 5.3 Pointers and Arrays. The section begins: ""In C, there is a strong relationship between pointers and arrays, strong enough that pointers and arrays really should be treated simultaneously."" ...etc, etc, etc..."

"Also, I don't think you need DDK to read reparse points (no such thing as ""parse points"").  See the FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT flag on CreateFile or the FSCTL_GET_REPARSE_POINT flag for DeviceIoControl.  Whether or not these will help depends on your answer to my earlier comment."
"It must be a string. If it is just a block of memory then strncpy will stop as soon as it finds a null. Binary data should use memcpy, not strncpy"
it's not much use except for a poor man's debugging. One other rather esoteric use is to printf %p out pointer values to a file then scanf them back with %p. The standard guarantees the resulting pointer be equal to the one written out if it's the same program.

"Glad you sorted it, Jan, and good spotting!  Next time, maybe try outputting the plans in Text mode, and then using a textual diff or merge tool to compare them.  You'll spot the difference(s) faster that way."
Exactly. SPs arn't an evil thing that should never be created (alot of non ORM users seem to be under the impression that we think this). A super complex query that is a common bottle neck in the application is a great use for stored procs.

IT would be possible to host it as a web part on the SharePoint site. What would be the best way to go about the conversion?

In case you decide to fix your answer you need to change your score/10 on the first line to be (score/10)*10 for both of them otherwise you get 3 - 12 instead of 30-39 etc. As per my post below you could add an order by to get the results in the right order.
I suppose it would be horribly picky to suggest that the first condition should be 'if free contiguous block exists and combined block is big enough' or something similar...
"I'm kind of shocked that you're still using a Microsoft Fortran compiler.  (Their last Win32 Fortran compiler was in 1994, was it not?)  Most people I know who develop Fortran on Windows are using either DEC / Compaq / HP / Intel Visual Fortran or MinGW-derived gfortran."

but that's the fun of it!
"There's another problem with this -- ticks is not atomically accessed; and since it's a two byte value, it's possible for the interrupt to fire in the middle of the comparison operation, and cause a misreading of ticks."
"Why does the call-by-reference pragma need to be there to begin with?  Does Microsoft Fortran not use call by reference by default, like other Fortran compilers do?  (Or is call by value the default only for DLLs?)"
yield just makes the compiler generate code for a state machine which doesn't need any disposing beyond normal GC
"On the other hand, if the binary code works, there is no reason to recompile.  That's probably a strong disincentive to upgrade."
"The bucket fill/deplete approach is good.  However, you are accessing a multi-byte variable without protection.  During the comparison or subtration, one half of the int could be processed, and then the ISR fires and increments the variable, and then the second half of the int it processed => error."
I don't know - I think there are more obscure things that the framework supports. I'm still slightly surprised that there isn't a row copy (as that should be blittable).
You're welcome @Robert :)
Things will usually be messed up even if the memory is not reallocated between the two calls to free.
Your free() wrapper must either be a macro or must use a different interface from the standard free() function.

TDD really is the revolutionizing practice in a totally different scale than BDD. Still I've come to appreciate way of writing test-drivenly in BDD style.
Another option would be to take the original source and create a new source (collection or whatever) that includes the first value and the source data and then bind to your new composite source.

"DiGi, I do agree, but nevertheless - D2007 is so much more stable than 2005/2006 than it's definitely worth the upgrade. And D2009 is even better (but we're not prepared yet to make a full switch to Unicode so we're still using D2007 internally)."

"@Quinane: depending on the ressources, you want deterministic freeing. Typically, for files (or locks; although I think RAII does not work taht well for threads either), you want to control exactly when you free the ressource."
well even with setName you should state things like  What happens when you set null?  Are there are name restrictions?  @see tags to methods that use the name or to constants that should be used  any exceptions that might be thrown  etc. etc...

"One thing I do question, though, is whether the theoretical 49% bound is typically achieved before collisions force you to rehash. The real-world density of the hash might be considerably less than 49%, I don't know. Presumably the academic papers answer that, I just haven't read 'em."

But surely you wouldn't want to put such an onclick handler on every link on your site that requires it be opened in a new window/tab.
But is there any other function I can use within getJSON to determine errors encountered or to determine when the call is complete?
how long did it take you to write that?  I think it would take less time to glue C++ to python and do it in one line.

Thanks. Is it possible to page or scroll the list of errors or warnings? I have more than it can show me at once and can't seem to find a way to show them all.
In terms of Clearcase being slow - when do you find it slowest? What's the problem exactly? There are many aspects to ClearCase - is it the development or the build environment that you are getting most of your problems from?
Sound good - I'll check it out.
"The move to version 7 is painful, I totally agree. Our process has taken just as long (and seems to be stretching out forever) - especially coming away from Rational Suite into individual v7 products."
Sometimes. It depends on the setting of the Security option ‘Allow programmatic clipboard access’. In IE7's security default ‘Medium-high’ it's set to ask before allowing access.

If there were one right answer the database would do it already. There's always a trade off. You could have 100's of indexes and queries would always run fast but inserts and updates would drag. Which is better? Because your query runs frequently doesn't mean it's the most important job to you.

You could build that dictionary up with a helper method which did the whole reflection thing - and possibly have a wrapper method which did precisely that - but a dictionary sounds like it's closer to what you're really trying to represent; anonymous object initializers are just syntactically handy.

"This is mostly incorrect - the first method you show is not an event handler, but an override. There is a huge difference and I suggest you read up on the subject. The way you would have to wire-up things manually is to have code, typically in the constructor, like this:"
The problem with using /nodefaultlib to fix the link errors is that the definitions of some runtime library structures change depending on the compiler settings. Also libraries might change *their* structures depending on the compiler settings. You might then hit strange behaviour.
"The purpose of ii instead of i is that it's easier to search for.  But if you have an IDE that can do ""Find Whole Word"", it's not really a big deal."

"PLEASE follow this advice. Parameters are not any slower to write than the hodgepodge of quote, escape and concatination that string building requires, and will provide you with multiple benefits. No SQL injection, easier to edit and query plan caching to start."
"Note that this code isn't creating any instances of type though - just List<type>, which doesn't care about what constructors are available for the type."

It is indeed calling executenonquery twice.  I still haven't figured out why though.
"I've considered this, but I remember trying something similar in the past and it seemed much slower. Also, it's possible that certain records might be deleted from Database A, so they need to be removed in Database B. Not even sure if the Merge would handle that either."

"I would occasionally use `do {} while ()`, if it is a short code block."
What you want is an expression parser.  I did this once by converting the expression from infix to postfix then using a stack based posfix parser.  Algorithms for both of these are well defined and exist on the web and in books.
"Thanks, I have downloaded it and it looks pretty good."
"Right, exactly why we have set ticks as an unsigned character. Its value should never exceed 50  following what I suggested."
Part of the problem is worrying about the execution time of every piece of code.
Can't immediately see what's wrong - what compile error did you get?
"Yeah, I thought about this method later on, but didn't take the time to actually program it all out."
A MemoryStream is all in-memory - there's no file handle here.
"Another thing you can learn from these is historic, how they managed to get it to work on the hardware of the day."
The ISRs are all optimised for speed and run under 1 ms each. So even in the worst case there is an error of only a insignificant duration.
"No, there are no Courier RPMs for Fedora. -frown- This has, however, prompted me to take a second look at the latest Dovecot, which I already have.

"It took me many more seconds :-) We call it ""Maggiolino"""
"Your title and content of the question contradict on which OS information you want, please correct as appropriate."
You need the help of somebody who can do this. Software deployment is easy to do on a domain.  Creating entries in the Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel is a good thing.
"In this case, the function is returning a MemoryStream because it provides ""data that can be interpreted differently depending on calling parameters"", so it could have been a byte array, but was easier for other reasons to do as a MemoryStream.  So it definitely won't be another Stream class."

"The book ""SQL-99 Complete, Really"" says that Sybase (and hence MS SQL Server) behave in the nonstandard way, allowing INTO to be optional.  Other brands of database require the keyword."

Also I'd tried limiting the result set: EXPLAIN ANALYZE select count(*) from data LIMIT 1; but the response times are pretty similar...
Even better point!
"In that case, I'd still *try* to dispose of it just on general principle - build good habits etc - but I wouldn't worry too much if it became tricky."

"Ask your reviewer exactly *why* he thinks you should close it. If he talks about general good practice, he's probably being smart. If he talks about releasing memory earlier, he's wrong."
Thanks.  I'd seen this link and code. I was just wondering if there was a way to do it without WSH.
"Agreed, another scenario is it gets constructed twice."
I don't think talking to database is an option since it is for anon. users and I may need to get different info. on different page on our site.
"Thank you for the reply.  I was afraid this might be the answer.  I tried signing the assembly (clicking the sign assembly checkbox and creating the key), but that didn't work.

"Matt, I'll echo what Danimal said: your explanation is great!"
I'd be interested to see this too.  I'm pretty much convinced that it's impossible to actually code good OO in C++ due to lack of GC and the weight of new classes and the nature of C++ programmers to resist constant memory allocations/deallocations (new objects). Most OO programmers I know agree.

You call the trimming code before you serialize. What benefit is there to keep a trimmed and untrimmed instance of what the user typed? Maybe there's a reasonable use case of which I'm not aware.

What kind of optimization can you perform on comparing upper case strings that can't be done on lower case strings?  I don't understand why one would be more optimal than the other.
Excellent point on thinking abstractly.  That's something I never considered.
The problem is apparent if you attempt to debug the Csharp app. It fails to realise it needs to rebuild the DLL.
"Why don't you use instead links for this, instead of replicating these JDKs and whatnot? It doesn't seem right to be worrying about duplicating things that certainly don't need duplication. Unison WILL sync links... so that would work, and relieve you of some space needs and some headaches"
"I am trying to copy the repo once.  The diff didn't quite work, as it leaves out binary files, instead I am trying to checkout the troublesome revision, use winmerge to merge the changes to the new repo and syncing from there."

I just found out about PostSharp and went hunting for this question to post it as an answer.
"I could, but then it would kind of defeat the purpose.  XML serialization results in larger objects than binary serialization.  Even after the XML is compressed, I doubt (I haven't tested this) that it would have a smaller footprint than the default binary serialization the ASP.NET framework does."
Someties it is important to know the difference between a Null and an empty string though. For example setting a value to an empty string as opposed to a value just never being set.
That one's so stupid it underflows and becomes awesome
"True, but you'll have the same problem with chars, and can simplify the conditions to check as follows:  1: The default value of 1 (Ace) is 11, unless your total is already greater than 21, in which case it's 1. 2: If the value of the card is more than 10, make it equal 10, else use it's own value."

I've set up Tibems.SetExceptionOnFTSwitch(true) so I'm now seeing when our connection fails.  We have not yet been able to test in a failover setting but I am getting the exceptions when the connection goes away.    Built-in reconnect isn't working when the server comes back though.
"We've checked server-client and client-server heartbeats.  They were disabled in the test environment and I thought that might be the cause for reconnect not working.  Enabled, set to 10s and we still don't get reconnect attempts."
"To answer the question why I need to know which is faster: I don't need to know, I merely want to know. :)  It's simply a case of seeing somebody make a claim (such as ""comparing upper case strings is faster!"") and wanting to know whether it is really true and/or why they made that claim."
The fact that I can trap for server connection failure is a good sign but I'd rather have the reconnect logic from the EMS library do its job than have to loop reconnect tries manually.

This is completely wrong - OR'ing with 32 only works for A-Z and characters 64-127; it screws up all other characters.  AND'ing with 32 is even more wrong - the result will always be 0 (nul) or 32 (space).

"Very easily - take a collection where every single operation is thread-safe in itself. Now iterate over it - bang, thread-safety is gone.

Very strange though that you'd have such little memory available that you couldn't add 50000 small objects to a hash.  Doesn't sound like that much.

.NET most certainly *does* run inside a VM. Just because it's JIT-compiled doesn't make the CLR any less of a VM.
this helps. although the inherited wsdl doesn't appear to be compatible with it because it doesn't conform to WS-I Basic Profile v1.1.

"If the test framework can pinpoint the location of failure in a test with multiple assertions, that goes a long way in easing the stricture of unit testing. I really can go either way here as far as your examples above are concerned."
You are absolutely correct.  I updated the code to cast the string if Session is not null.

"Any model with states and transitions can be treated as a graph problem.  At the top of the graph is the starting position.  All possible moves can be child nodes.  Breadth first makes is easier to remove duplicate states from the search.  Blimey, you don't get many characters for a comment, do you?"
For a float multiplication with 2 is just a matter of adding 1 to the exponent. But I don't think compilers optimize that.
What's wrong with Zend_Db_Table_Row::findDependentRowset()?
The compiler actually doesn't have to emit any extra instructions for a divide - that's what SAL is for - it handles two's complement numbers properly.
@David: Be grateful I picked a photo without my glasses on then :)
Thanks that some great things to think about.
"@rslite, given the efficiency of floating point units in CPUs these days, it is likely that it would be quicker to let the FPU do the multiplication, rather than doing an integer addition to just part of the number's bit set."
"What about negative values? Bit shifting should only work for unsigned variables, right?"
"@Lee: No, you don't get many characters :) I would agree with your analysis if it were really transitional in the normal sense. But think about what effect it has to do move X then move Y vs move Y then move X in this particular case."

"By all means, re-think your entire database architecture to tune a single query. De-normalizing isn't a query tuning step.  Table scans aren't costly when the other choice is performing an index scan followed by table access by rowid when you need 100% of the rows in the first place."

Okay I had that ... but it's not working for some reason. What do I do about the View?
"@Jon: Does the fact that XY results in the same state as YX mean this is not transitional?  Wouldn't you just have node 1 referencing nodes 1.1 and 1.2, node 1.1 would reference node 1.1.1, and node 1.2.1 could either be disarded as a duplicate of 1.1.1 or 1.2 could reference 1.1.1 directly?"

"I hadn't really thought about, but yes.  Testing only one thing (or small things) does make TDD possible.   If your tests were large, TDD would be an abysmal way to write software."
"When you write narrowly-focused unit tests, it can be quicker to find and fix defects in the code. It is also easier to measure your progress; if you are testing 50 features, it is more meaningful to show that 30 tests in 50 pass than to show that 1 test in 5 passes."
"Well, you may not catch a bug in your code that happens only when you add and do not remove."
"If you are getting just warnings and the code is generated, probably you can use it without problem. Wsdl.exe always tries to generate Basic Profile compliant code unless there is something in WSDL that is not compatible."
"I do agree with your point: while a best practice may be to test only one feature per test, your environment may dictate that you test multiple features."
I would assume they would all have the same view. Your view can be called whatever you want so long as you call the View(string) overload and the View's aspx is in the Users sub directory under Views.

"Moreover, if you build the ws client proxy from visual studio you probably received similar warnings. You can create a client proxy with wsdl.exe and compare it with the one that you have in your project."
"@Treb, there are two kinds of bit shifts, arithmetic shifts and logical shifts.  The former keeps sign, the latter does not.  One would hope the compiler is smart enough to figure out which to use."

"on windows, 2048 won't even let you start the VM.  the max on 32bit windows you max out around 1.4G depending on what other dll's are loaded.  on OSX, like the original poster says, the VM may or may not start if you try max memory as the MX param."
"This could interfere with other installed software, it makes it hard for new developers to get set up and it makes it hard to distribute updates to those DLLs to your team. A new developer should be able to walk in, do a get from source control and compile without a bunch of dependencies."
"It means that there's little point in looking at it as a tree - it makes more sense to look at any one attempt as a *set* of flips instead of a *path* of flips. IMO, anyway :) Working out all possible sets is easier than working out all possible paths."
Won't this work in combination with find-file-literally?
"The stable version of cppunit lacks many assertions, and requires a lot of hand written and redundant code that frameworks like cxxtest or fructose are able to infer automatically (thanks to external scripts actually). cppunit may be a port of a good Java framework, but it missed C++."

"It's the same algorithm as mattiast's (who posted 4 seconds quicker). Right, (foldr step done xs) returns a function that consumes ys; so we go down the xs list building up a nested composition of functions that will each be applied to the corresponding part of ys."
Also far more complex in some ways. I wold have to parse the XML (or whatever) and then build a parser from it that can be immediately run. The advantage would be less 'code' but to make that work I would need to avoid needing to write code for the actions in the grammar (Ouch).

I have to disagree with that advice. Often Dispose is just a no-op and calling it just clutters up your code.

This is the very nature of reflection in general ... not at all specific to Constructor.newInstance().

"We've got a license key already which does well. Trouble is, we're looking at *sub-licensing* and that's a big part of the concern."
Sublicensing? You mean it will get re-sold/distributed? In that case you really have to audit your resellers and have good contracts and lawyers. If you are in the position of reselling then you can probably also afford a good technical solution. An initial activation is also possible and common.

"It's not such much the cardinality of the column as a whole that matters.  It is the selectivity of the WHERE clause.  So if there are few columns with value 1, it can still be good to index.  If it's 50/50 (e.g. male/female) then not so worth it."
That only works if both databases are on different servers.
"And it is quite easy to leak memory when using RAII and smart pointer anyway. For example, a signal handler which changes the code path and never returns to the callee: neither RAII or smart pointer will help you in that case."
"No, it doesn't, but things like SEO are usually better if there isn't a key in it - especially something as long as a GUID. Of course, it can be worked around easily, so I gues that was a bit of an over sweeping statement"

"I had posted an answer about Huffman coding.  Reading your response made me pause and think about how Huffman coding is done, and you're right, random writes would spoil the encoding."
In the case of writes you will never need extra padding. You just will have to re-compress both blocks who share the boundary that is crossed.  This is because there is no API that will insert data into a position of a file.

"Likewise, I began omitting the closing tag after having read about it in regard to security best practices. However, after having done so, we discovered that our e-learning apps began failing and putting the closing tags back in fixed it."
Thanks.  10 points for effort!
Please note the caveat to my post which stated that we never fully debugged the problem so I can't and won't say for certain that omitting the closing tags was the real cause of the problem or if this only exposed a problem which was unknown.

"This is true of every solution.  All the solutions that say ""use your own stack"" also may run out of heap space.

Correct. boost::shared_ptr explicitly does not provide a policy based implementation for simplicity reasons.
(c <= '/' || c >= ':') is a bit strange looking. I would have used (c < '0' || c > '9')... are the <= and >= operators faster in Java?
First you could make one constructor call the other.. but then.. eventually you might want to consider separating all constructors from everything else to facilitate Dependency Injection (don't construct yourself.. have a factory do it for you..)

The optimizer *should* take care of making count(*) take just as much time as count(1). I guess some optimizers don't.
One objection to findDependentRowset() and findParentRow() is that it's less efficient to lazy-load related rows one at a time than to query both tables with a JOIN when you know from the start that you need all the related rows.

Creating a spec isn't old school.  You and your users need to know what needs to be delivered.  How can you program features that you don't know about?  You also shouldn't be spending time on features that aren't needed.  In this case a spec is absolutely necessary and should be easy to create.

It looked like the standard parser but I wasn't sure if I it was the actual class or if it was an individual translation from the C++ SAX parser...   I still think you need something that can handle messy XML unless you are sure that it is validated. Try looking at apache digester...
"Use of """" creates a 1 byte literal object. If the compiler is not smart each one is different and thus could potentially bloat the code. I would suspect the compiler is smart enough to optimize this away and thus this is a false gain and complicates the code."

"Note here also, that there's no inversion happening, and that the system is solved directly, as per John D. Cook's answer."
You need to reassign it back to the original variable as replacement doesn't occur in place.
I really don't like that this approach gets so much attention.  The performance hit you take is actually somewhat substantial.
"That would have been my advice too, in fact templates become much more powerful by adding variables and tabstops within, so your example above would become dbHandle ctrl+space.  It would copy snipets from both parts and place your cursor right in the middle."

"Like todays world, where every browser goes on their own way for such corner cases.."
"Yes, thanks particularly for addressing abbreviations."
Prefixing every sproc with _usp doesn't help distinguish among them. I think some DBA's like that prefix because it indicates the database object type. Maybe we'll hear from one of them who likes it.
"Well, you never know, when you're working on a database dedicated to one app, whether there will be another app later using the same database. In your situation, it sure does help segregate the sprocs."

Are you planning to unit test the various concrete instrument classes or are you using simulators and hardware varification?
You have to start your literals with _ (non-_ literals are reserved for future use for the standard). Which is a shame.

"Yep, was going to answer this.  The paging pattern in Linq is implemented by the Skip and Take methods.  if i is the number of items in a page, and j is the number of the page you wish to view, you would skip i * (j-1) items and take i."

"Hardware latency is best handled using some sort of enterprise monitoring tool, or vendor specific profiling tools.  Profiling Authentication and Authorization providers (like AD) is tough.  You may want to write a simple application that auths against your AD and check the latency on that."

Since the signal is downsampled with a integral factor (44 to 11 khz is 1:4) it will not be too bad. Perfect resampling is an art.
"As you can see from my example, using an XmlDataProvider can greatly simplify your xaml by allowing you to break out all the templates for your tree into HDT's.  You can get that XDocument into one in your codebehind, no problem.  But if this works for you, more power to ya."
"I get the impression in the second paragraph, you are talking about proximity - i.e. closeness of the two devices in the same room.

mmm... if you have both 'read' and 'READ' you won't be able to update. I think all the referencing table should be updated and then the record with 'READ' dropped. With an 'ON DELETE RESTRICT' on the foreign key there is no risk miss anything.

"I generally abhor the use of underscores, but the way you use it -- not just to segregate the prefix, but also to segregate the operation -- would make it easier to find when scanning a list of hundreds of sprocs. Pretty_neat_idea."
That's a great answer but the number of lines per page can vary on each page so the page break collection is an index into where each line that starts a new page is.
I will use unit tests

Because the Rails' convention is to have a controller per resource.
You could start by posting your 1.5 examples.
"The biggest problem with this is you lose intellisense and type safety.  Plus, you now have an additional dependency between the view and the model (that can't be enforced by the compiler) in that they both must know and understand what ""foo"" and ""bar"" means..."
"Now, there's an interesting take on the prefix. That looks like a good way to segregate sprocs by their usage."
"The code is a weighted average over a window. It is probably calculated from a inverse DFT of a filter function on frequency domain. You can use a 4 element array and experiment with the values, something like [0.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1] , until it sounds good."

"I voted you down, mainly because there is a non-deprecated way of doing this: using-declarations, i.e. `using std::size_t`, and you didn't mention this as a better alternative. :-)"
"That means that the value isn't substituted for your expression at runtime, its set permanently at compile time.  In order to get the value, the code interpreting the lambda would have to understand the concept of the user control and how to extract it"
"It will be used a web based MS Excel clone. The user mostly edit cells, but adding/deleting rows and columns are also common operations.  As a plus, the user can download data as CSV any time."
"The actuall function returns a std::string so there's no problem with returning a pointer, anyway string literals are stored in the data segment of the program so it's well-defined to return a pointer to a literal from a function."
"And unless the code that is interpreting the expression has access to your conntrol and is coded to do this, it isn't possible.  If the code has an overload or another method that does the same thing, but takes actual values, you can use that and a lambda to retrieve the value at runtime."
An important point is that lists have additional pointers per element while a vector just has three pointers for the whole data structure.
Great!  (My workplace bans Boost :( )
That's a really good point.  I hadn't though of this when I was discussing it with my coworker.
This was for a project I worked on a while ago where we were using an older version of the Arm Developer Suite (ADS) compiler to build for several ARM processors.  I'm really just asking to settle a discussion about how other compilers handle this.
":-D ... No, I'm not. Ok, the first is contract programming, where you ask an object if he implements some interface. If yes, you then use the inferface. The second is used when you have complex class hierarchy, and don't want your base Object class to implement the method draw from Shape..."
@Grank: Lambda expressions can be converted into either expression trees or delegates. It sounds like you're thinking of the conversion into delegates.
Could you provide a bit more detail?
1 I can agree with. 2 sounds like a broken hierarchy.
this only works if you have ButtonType set to Button
"The ""2"" is the .5 part... :-D ... It's not as much broken as it is extended.

Oh! Thanks for correcting this one!
"Locals almost always have to be dumped to the stack at some point.  The only exception to this is if your function *never* calls another function, in which case everything is transient and can be handled without a stack frame."

This will be very slow when you have a large database. Can you do this with lazy loading enabled?
Bad idea: using output functions often serializes your threads because cout uses locks. This can destroy the problem you are trying to find.

Any difference will almost certainly be obscured by the cost of retrieving the values in the first place. And a few hundred times a second is nothing. The cost of the stack frame to *call* your function will likely dwarf anything you've shown. Smells like premature optimization.
"He'd still have to initialize them each time to get the same behavior. And ""allocation"" for local variables amounts to a different baked-in stack pointer increment. So either way, the cost is the cost of initialization."
"Yes.  Not all of it, but most of the UI uses .Net"

"Thanks, this is useful, but not exactly what I need. I would like to have some command line tool, if javadoc not allows to do what I need."
Thanks for the advice. I had also ran into the Cartesian Join issue you mentioned above in a few other queries a was working on and that made a huge difference in time and now the queries actually return what they are supposed to. Go figure.
"I have tried both. The Google incubator has currently some unresolved issues and I'm not willing go with it to production. The GWT widget library looks promising but there is no examples to see it in action, plus the documentation is very thin."

"After reading the first lines of Your post, I wondered why I could not remember posting some details about my aircraft simulation. :-D  This should proove, that there are some examples of useful RTTI."
DFT works in buffers. This introduces all kinds of extra problems. You need to do windowing to eliminate problems at the buffer edges and mix the buffers back togehter with overlap using overlap-save or overlap-add methods. FIR or IIR filters are better.
thanks jon -  could you give an example starting with a MemberInfo object though?
"I like that it complains - gives a cue that, yes, it is indeed an infinite loop."
I just meant to have the loop index start at 1 rather than at 0.  Do the first item before the loop starts.
"Of what kind? MemberInfos can be properties, fields, methods, events or other types. You can't treat them all the same way.  What would be the ""value"" of a nested type, for instance? Perhaps you should tell us more about your problem."
"Interesting. I've done something similar using inheritance of a base class with a single protected 'int' member, but a template class would have saved me a bit of code duplication if I'd thought of it!"

I had to laugh when I read this one. My boss did this very thing on one of our projects just last month. Reduced header includes by a couple of factors.
"Very true about the event log.  This can be mitigated if you have a good deployment strategy, though."
Got it - works a charm!
"Regarding derived attributes: Perhaps the best example is when computation of derived attribute involves an UDF. With a computed column in a table, any change of the UDF is real pain in the ass."
There is no java version of System.Net.WebRequest?
"Regarding frequencies of changes, additions, and deletions of columns: It obviously depends on the system. In our case changes happen much more frequently than additions and deletions."
Thanks for posting the answer once you found it. We use JasperReports and honestly I did not realize it could do this. This is pretty nice. Thanks again.

"Yes, but the compiler is free to call (i++) before or after the call to erase, so if the compiler decides to do (i++) after erase then i is invalid."
What's wrong with regular exceptions?
"@Jonathan: What Daniel said, for the most part - although WebRequest gives you more control than URL. HTTPClient is closer in functionality, IMO."
"It can even assign multiple variables to the same register or stack location if it can prove that the variables are never alive in the same section of code.  This is common practice, especially with inlined code that leads to short variable lives."
Would you mind elaborating on why GetRange() is a better option than Skip() and Take()?
"that makes sense - I'm eternally curious on stuff like this, too :)"
If you process everything at once DFT's can take very long. A DFT takes O(n^2). You could use an FFT but that only works if the buffer-size is a power of two. Usually you achieve that by cutting the signal in smaller buffers.
same error as before.
Modified question to answer that.
"Yes sorry, that's what I meant too. The problem is that the app is not being rebuilt despite the fact that the DLL *has* been changed and rebuilt. ie. the dependecies are enough to trigger a build of the DLL, but not the app!"
Well if you're going to take all the fun out of it... ;)
"Sorry again, it's on a pre-build event. Of course, post build events can be set to always get executed. I will try this..."
C++ does not have a specific ABI. But the ones I have read always reserve one for the this pointer. So no gain. Plus you forget the cost copying in-to/out-of locals.
"I have the platform sdk installed, and it isn't there"
This is because one some phones even for GameCanvas back-buffering is not implemented.
needs error checking
Now. This is a satisfying solution!
"@Jon: bah, humbug ;-p"
Please note that I have omitted error checking in the interest of clarity.
"you are right, these things should be mentioned, too."
You don't need the filename - you can use fstat for that.
"Add ""fd = fileno(f);"" if you have a stream (e.g. from fopen), not a file descriptor.  Needs error checking."
"Well, actually, I've seen more problems with using the MS driver. Another thing to try is to use a bare-bones case using a text argument instead of integer."
"Why would it be particularly slow? You're only loading the same amount of data you'd be loading anyway, and then ""linking"" the relevant bits in memory. Obviously a hashtable will make finding things quicker than the simpler O(N * M) approach described in the first option, but I wanted to stay simple"
Of course it needs error checking - that would just complicate the example.
Same holds for ulong
Good point. I've re-tagged my post; we're still using 2005.
"No, that still doesn't work :( Starting the app in the debugger (F5) triggers a rebuild of the DLL, but *not* the app, so the post-build event isn't fired, even when it's set to build always."
"I'm still kind of curious what was wrong with my original code by HttpListener works great. I think rather than waste any more time, I'm just going to go with that for now.  Thanks!"

Surprisingly I have never encountered the checked and unchecked contexts. This is great.

Similarly you can use an explicit unchecked block and cast -1 to a uint if you really really want to. i.e. unchecked{ uint z = (uint)-1; }
Inputting an integer implies that it only works on random access iterators. I was hoping to avoid such a restriction if possible.
"Please provide some details on ""get information on them""."

I have an array of views that I create in the appdelegate and I add a different array to each tab view controller. Then the controller uses that array to create uiviews with animation to toggle between them. I'm having trouble with the animation toggling...
"Because you're not loading the same amount of data you might need to load. There is a many to many relationship between subregions and countries, so left outer joins or multiple queries will be needed. These are expensive."
Not enough chars in commments. You will load all subregions with for each a different collection of countries and with for each country a different collection of subregions. That will be a lot of calls to the database when you just want to display the name of one country.
A lazy loaded collection is only loaded when you access it. So GetCountries().WithId(1) will make 1 call to the database and GetCountries().WithId(1).SubRegions will make 2 calls. Your version will make the maximum amount of db calls in every situation or I'm I misunderstanding somthing?

I'm looking into the book now. Boost calls them signals and slots I think.. and it seems they were doing a whole lot more than I needed. I may end up having to go more deeply into that though.
Besides the signals and slots in .NET (Visual C++) you have events and delegates. you can read more on them :)
not really a C++ solution if you use .net

"GetRange leverages the internal implementation of List.  Skip/Take uses the contract of IEnumerable (which involves enumerating).  If the List has a million elements in it, you'll get to elements 950,000 through 950,010 faster using GetRange."

"I'd say here you'd use template< class PayLoad > class Event : public PayLoad {}. Of course, you could also just derive the other way round and spare the template. It's not so neat, though. :)"
within the decleration of the fire() function you would just use public fire(PayLoad); ? and declare and event like event myEvent<float>?

That is how I would do it if you can't write it in Perl.
"You would create different kinds of PayLoad classes and have them contain, for example, float foo. But I strongly suggest going for a derived class rather than a templated approach for your needs. Define a Event-class and then define a class FooEvent : public Event { float foo; } Use references!"

I think possible user frustration is a very valid concern. You'd definitely want to prototype for user acceptance if you go this route. I think you are definitely in a tight spot here with concurrency vs usability.

The class involves Polish pre-processing. I already tried the different package idea but got stuck due to dependencies on other classes that expose package-private members.

"You probably have, as I mentioned in my answer, a ""detached HEAD"". Check .git/HEAD; if it does NOT have ""ref: refs/heads/master"" (or another ref: line), you have a detached HEAD, and your commits will go to no branch, only to the HEAD."
"Hmm - I didn't call mine ShowDialog 'coz I was worried about trying to have a static method with the same name as an instance method, overloaded only by return type. I don't think that's possible."
Hmm? Both code blocks are indented and are syntax-highlighting just fine for me.
"No no no. That's the function of a directory, *not* of LDAP. That's like saying the function of SQL is to provide a database; it isn't; directories provide LDAP access, not the other way around."

In what cases are they faster? passing references around is just as fast as passing primitives around.
But then you're hitting the database twice -- inefficient. (Which must be why Pax deleted his solution.)
"Pretty big approcach for such a simple problem, isn't it?"

"You're only hitting the database twice if your database doesn't optimise it.  Probably a safe assumption, but an assumption nonetheless."
"Pax deleted his solution because it started getting downvotes, despite being the only non-vendor specific solution :-).  Probably better to have a comprehensive list of all the vendor-specific optimized solutions and readers can choose which one they want."
The reason is that I don't want to load a rather large DLL into my memory space for the sake of only one method call. It would be good if someone points an implementation (probably uses Regex) that I can copy/paste into my project.
It's not that it diffs it on the server. VSS is not a client/server architecture. The VSS client just uses Windows file sharing to work with its database files.

Your design...  There's something wrong with it.
His question specifically says 'web framework'
This is a much better way of looking at it.
"I disagree.  Why wait for performance to become a problem when you can write efficient code in the first place?  9 times out of 10 you don't need the extra functionality that the wrapper class offers, so why use one?"
Each person has a subjective opinion on which stands out.  Not everyone will agree.  This type of discussion only leads to each person defending their language of choice or attacking someone else's.

"I just don't get the whole ""fear of lock-in"". You're always locked into SOMETHING every time you use software. IMHO, get over it. If the app solves your problem, stop whining about lock-in."

"Make that ANY derived class. Not a ""manager"" class."
In other words -- you have a flaw in your design :)
"As long as we're talking about sizeof, I'd say you should write that as:  p = malloc(n * sizeof *p); This is shorter, and does not use the needless (in my opinion confusing and obfuscating) parenthesis around the argument. Those are only needed with type names, not with other objects."
It's not a flaw.
"@DOK In general, if something is open (source) you are not locked into a proprietary software and its standards, formats etc.."
"Yeah, I've done that, but I want a compile-time exception."
He can do it by putting those two in a separate assembly and using internal. Quit ugly solution though and it is clearly a design flaw. C# is not Java neither C++ as it does not have 'friend' classes.

"There are many features of the Java language that I require only occasionally. That's not to say that they are not useful or that they should not have been added. Autoboxing is a useful feature in certain circumstances, but I think it unnecessary to use wrappers just for the sake of having them."
"DrJokepu:  True, but note the ""clean"" qualifier in my sentence!"
Who said it requires anything?  And that's not linq; thats a lambda.  I'm giving the manager a delegate the manager can use to set the private property in the managed class.  Its one of many ways to do this kind of thing.
"I've quadruple-checked it. Putting all the files in C:\Temp and it crashes. Rename the directory to ""Te mp"" and it works. I'll try filemon."

"True, but hotels don't actually document who's IN the rooms, they document who's paying for the rooms.  And hotels also have a primary contact for their bookings so they know who to contact when the check bounces..."

"OK, then the design absolutely stinks. Which in my view is a flaw :)"
"Note that different framework versions (esp. ""client profile"") are a valid reason to avoid it - but not worth getting *too* excited over it ;-p"

"If both INSERTs must succeed (or fail) together, enclose them in a transaction using ""BEGIN TRANS;"" AND ""COMMIT;"" OR ""ROLLBACK;"" statements. Alternatively, if $conn is a ADODB connection object, you can use it's native methods (""BeginTrans()"","" CommitTrans()"", ""RollbackTrans()"")."
It'll be interesting to try this solution side-by-side with a vendor-specific one when I get to work tomorrow.
"BTW, the manager DOES NOT have to be created by the class it is managing.  You can hand it ANY instance of Managed.  I just did it that way in the example."
How would you make this fool-proof!? and Yes I would agree that you would need to be foolish before even considering this as a solution!

Thanks for the explanation and the workaround. I am still surprised though that the outer list ends up holding three references to an anonymous inner list.
"Yes you can. According to the question tags this is C++, so objects can go on the stack. And new isn't a declaration, it's an expression. Declaring something and allocating it are separate things."
This breaks if I have a page that just has a script tag with excanvas.  I'm hoping someone can explain what that invalid argument message might be.
I don't think daylight savings time affects currentTimeMillis().  It'd defined in terms of UTC.
Does that work on Windows Mobile devices? What do I have to include?
"Oh, and increased CPU etc significantly too (it takes time to do encoding/decoding, even for ASCII)"
and you dont take any formatting differences into account
"While that's a good idea, I can't promise a specification now that might turn out, during testing, to not be capable of handling my scripts.  It really needs to be test-proof right now, which seems to imply that I should pick some fairly high specs to begin with!"
"I don't have direct experience with Windows Mobile, but this is part of C++, not the OS. You need to #include <string>."
"That just tells me the browser specs, not the hardware specs?"

"Yup, I've seen the answer above. It can be done, will edit my answer accordingly."
"Except I think @fizzer was explaining how you *might* end up with size_t in the global namespace in your C++ program, not making a recommendation that you *do* so."
The encoding was just for the test... to write the sample file. Treating the file as text certainly might be an issue though.
"Technically, an interface is a class with only abstract methods. So Java actually has multiple inheritance, (only allowed for interfaces.) The reason for this is that the problem with multiple inheritance mostly related to instance variables. (and partly method implementations)"
"I've tried several different ways to organise my notes. I've tried OneNote, I've tried index cards, I've tried sticky notes, I've tried Notepad.  In the end I always come back to an A4 lined pad and a fine-point gel pen."
That would actually work even without interfaces. (Duck typing.) Interfaces merely makes it possible for you to tell the compiler your intent.

"If you have multiple applications calling the same procedure then you need to be extra careful, any modification to that proc could break those multiple apps. Naming wise, it is a grey area, but you could name it common/global or anything you see fit. @localghosts: thanks for being informative."
"Inheritance tends to be brittle. If you are violating the ""is-a"" relationship that is implicit when you extend a superclass, you are asking for trouble down the road."
"Actually, the vehicle doesn't have to be an interface, it could be a base class. Interfaces are more suited for services or similar where you just care about the contract and not the inheritance, so i think polymorphism is actually not the important thing about interfaces."
The first won't work; # stringizes macro arguments in macro expansions.  The second will work.

"Table Scan's are too often seen as bad things and it is initially what inexperienced people would focus on.  This is highly dependant on the number of records being returned from that table, there is a threshold when its faster to do a full table scan rather than index lookup."
If you have your logging services designed in advanced you don't need me :)
"Good answer.  One more step - try to minimize the amount of 'stuff' that's necessary to reproduce it.  If the bug report involves a 50,000 line program, it is not going to be treated as well as a 100 line program that reproduces the problem."

Thanks for your feedback. Please see my original post for the edit I made. I think my question wasn't clear enough.
"It'll take less memory, but access time will probably be a bit slower, rather than faster.  Accessing an element requires the packed value to be unboxed to a real integer, which will slow the process down."
"Table scans are not all bad - depending on the number of records returned/processed from the table, a full table scan can be faster than an index scan (if you are going to bring back the records anyway, you'll do a index scan and a full read from the table - 2 steps instead of 1)."
"Yes, which is the general idea. Browser (functional) specs are okay, but you can't provide hardware specs because there are too many other variables to consider."
I agree with this answer.  +1
"As a side note, the LEGEND element is a little difficult to control with css. I was going to use absolute positioning, but ran into problems. In the end, I decided to forgo the LEGEND element and use a LABEL with a special class."

"Thank you for the clarification, I would recommend more or less what João Augusto described. I giess I cna remove my reply now :)"
"If everyone thinks they can add methods to a base class, then you get conflicts as people do this in parallel. It might not matter when you control all the source, but when you libraries that don't control, things get really weird."
"I agree that it's nice to put the value in the constructor. For very large enums (and they would really have to be pretty big) it would make sense to use a map.  I'd personally return from inside the loop as well, but then I've never been a fan of ""return from one place regardless of readability"" :)"
Sounds like the right conclusion.  You could use 'delimited identifiers' (the technical name for column names in quotes) everywhere; it is simpler not to.
"I tried this against 2008-10-28.  With DateFirst = 1 it gave me 2008-10-21.  With DateFirst = 7, it gave me 2008-10-22.  Neither of those are mondays."
One other point - it would be better to use EnumSet.allOf instead of AgeRange.values() as otherwise you create a new array for every call.
"The database is a central source of information, using config files leaves you at risk of having disparate configuration settings when you have multiple instances of an app."
"They can forge a request because they can create a 3rd party client application that logs into the api, at which point they can submit their own requests.  I need to verify the source of the api request."
"I would recommend a similar solution. Some provisions may be needed for concurrency (atomic update of the index AFTER data was appended), and of course automatic padding should be disabled, and manual padding used instead."
Use the d->D::Foo() syntax.  I put it in the example I added.
"Note that there is something special about *scratch*, at least in GNU Emacs 21 and later: switching to a new *scratch* buffer will put it back into Lisp Interaction mode."
"Revah: OK, you need to use inheritance correctly. But you have to write (amd maintain) so much more duplicate code with an interface vs. having a single version of the method (where appropriate) in a base class."
It also makes perfect sense when the code that uses it is in stored procedures.
Hmm... posted my update as an answer.  That worked.  But the system won't let me accept it.  I guess you can't answer your own question and mark it as the correct answer.  Makes sense.  Otherwise you could game the system in your favor.

Maybe because there are several clients connecting to the db which all use the same config data. Example: A program can send out email notifications via SMTP server. The URL of the server should be stored centrally.
"We have no idea what the ""GetFile"" variable type is... but you shouldn't need a FileStream at all, if it's fetching from the database into memory."

"Project Euler #3... that is a tough problem... I had the same issue. I also looked at BigInt lib, but I noticed that they didn't implement postfix operators correctly... so I figured there would be other problems lurking in their code."
"Interesting micro optimization, I'll have to remember this."
It is slightly unsafe to store raw passwords in the session depending on what the backing store is. Most of the time the backing is to disk and that will result in a password being stored in plain text on disk somewhere.
"The path is set, or the algorithm must figure out the best path?"
This worked fine for me on a minimal page. Does your page validate?
"This is potentially very unsafe.  Passing the username and password back and forth to the browser is just asking for trouble.  The session variable is the place to store this kind of data, although I would still recommend tokenising the data."
"A text file doesnt really restrict the length of the field though, whereas a database you must specify a length. So you need to pick something that is long enough for all values, but not so long that it becomes excessive."
"Your problem is not well specified yet. What do you mean by noisy? Do the points lie near, but not on, some ideal but complicated path which you seek to approximate? Do you have any a priori information about he shape of the path? ANy other way to get such information?"
I would like to to find the best path - it is otherwise unknown (just poorly sampled by the points).
Well it is more safe if you use one-way hashing.

Minor aside: you should be using Calendar.getInstance() rather than instantiating GregorianCalendar directly.  That remains flexible so that you don't have to change all your code when your app is run in India (e.g.).
Downvoted for the outrageous advice. 90% of performance problems are NOT solved by temp tables and splitting up a query. What world do you live in?!
"It validates at load time, yes. As far as I'm reading the HTML spec correctly, it validates after the change too (i.e. an address can replace a p in any context)."

Having someone that does include($_GET['p] . '.php') is enough to include arbitrary files (index.php?p=some_image.gif%00 or whatever). Uploading them as an image is one way to get those files on the server.

"We don't maintain authentication credentials within SVN, we're already serving the repository via Apache with domain-based authentication.  I'm looking for a *client* that doesn't require additional authentication."
"You're right, but this optimization depends on: 1 - You use the optimization, which in debug, usually, you won't (ie the code above won't work on debug). 2 - It is a built-in type, because objects have constructors/destructors. All in all, it is an optimization, not a feature we should rely upon."
"How much code have you written? Even in a decent-size app, I could switch from using Double to double in the time it took you to post this question!  As with (almost) any optimizations, profiling is the only thing which will tell you the size of the hit, if any."

"The conclusion is that we can't rely on potential optimization to have the compiler merge 3 similar strings defined in 3 different compilation units.

"Extension methods put you on a slippery slope...I think if you find yourself adding more than 2 extension methods for a given type, it might be time to examine why."
"I'm saying that is the safest way.  I would assume that, since the element may not be fully specified (missing end tag), the browser wouldn't add it to the DOM until it had been fully parsed.  I can't point at a standard that enforces this, though."

"@Andrew Top: ""std::string has considerable shortcomings to const char*, performance-wise"" It depends. Last time I checked, std::string::length() was faster than strlen...

"Those two examples, I would especially not like. The more generic the type, the less suitable it is for extension methods. The worst example is beginning to add ToInt32() method to Object, ToDateTime() etc. I'd much rather have these in separate classes."

It depends on if you want to use NHibernate already or not ;)
Good luck with that. Upstream python bindings suck. Very. Badly. That's why there are two different alternative bindings.

"You've missed the replacement blank string in the re.sub.  Also, this won't work for strings.  Eg. consider 'string uncPath = ""//some_path"";' or 'char operators[]=""/*+-"";'  For language parsing, I think you're best off using a real parser."
"@Chris Wenham: You would need more than simple admin access. WMI would have to be configured properly if you want to start/stop services, RDP would need to be configured properly to kick off process execution. Depending on your needs, even more would need to be uniquely configured."

"I can see why that is confusing, considering that it does indeed work with arrays (contrary to your answer), but not with other dynamic collections, like List<Point>."
I have no programming experience other than understanding of the basic concepts behind it.  This is mostly for the sake of my own curiosity to help me understand programming better from a theoretical point of view.
"I do need to store the 'value' or 'state' of particular objects, but can't decide if serialization is the answer or if I should manually parse them down into key value pairs, or vectors of data."
Some of the objects have quite complex data in that they contain other objects which contain other objects etc.
"Hi. Yes, I've just been looking at it. Seems very complicated but does look like you can fully automate it which would be fine. Thanks for the pointer."
"yes, the more i think about it, and the more i anticipate extensions, the more it sounds like a proper database is the answer.. initially i will have to implement some kind of manual file writing, but I expect i'll need to propose a database solution eventually."

"Sorry, send the commands to the DirectInput message que, where it can query it for the keyboard."
"OK - I weren't aware of that. I don't know if this is realistic for you, but you might try to iron out the kinks your self. Lua is famous for being easy to embed in C code (Which a php-extension is), so it shouldn't be too hard."
basically it is a bucket sort.  and the real value here is not the sort -it is how the data is stored.  I stand by my comment
"Just as I go out on a limb to get my point across, so does Yegge. Some of his points comes down to normal programming consideration - if the singleton keeps valuable resources open, that may be a problem, of course. Given careful consideration, there are places for singletons and statics alike."
"Yes, thanks, severalpeople have mentioned the Boost libraries - i'll check them out :)"
"You're right about that. In most implementation I saw, it resulted in the derived destructor not being called. But again, you're right, and one should not play polymorphism (i.e. delete it through its base pointer) to avoid undefined behaviour."
"Downloaded it last night, and its UI looks super simple to use."
The second variation is the preferred method.
"Do the points have an order, is the order of the points saved with the x,y data?"
Note that you should separate your argument checking and iteration into different methods - see http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2008/09/08/high-maintenance.aspx for details.
You're right. Thanks. I fixed my answer :). `arr[i].attr=` is special syntax for arrays that you cannot code in library containers ;(.  Why is (<value expression>).attr = <expr> allowed at all? Can it ever make sense?

"@Head Geek : Not exactly. If you have 2 objects, A and B, pointed through smart pointers, you're right. Now, if A points to B, too, and if B points to A, too, then you have a problem, and must decide who owns the object through the use of weak_ptr and/or shared_ptr."

Bezier will be way off the sampled points; probably more than helpful. Notice that the blue curve misses all the peaks in the gray one? Those misses are quite extreme already in this trivial case and they're not a good way to filter out noise methinks.

"Amen - by all means, focus on what actually makes a difference to your app's performance!"
".NET Code has never been interpreted. It is compiled from IL to native code, one method at a time. That is not interpretation. The method pointers are then modified to point at the compiled method, so that future calls always call the native code. Additionally, you can preJIT the entire assembly."
"What he probably meant was that during execution it's not usually interpreted, which is also true for .NET apps. CLR and most JREs now JIT compile the Java bytecode into native code the first time it's executed."
"With the introduction of the Hotspot VM, Java has the same JIT abilities that the CLR has always had. Yes, original Java was slow and interpreted, it is not now (Note your link is timestamped from 11 years ago)."
Damn. I just did that with a select operation this morning. Thank you very much.
"Well that IS from MY point of view an INTERPRETER. From yours it is not,  that's fine. But one set of bytecodes are ""interpreted"" totally different in Windows, Linux, and MacOSX, that's the job of the JVM. If the interpreter creates assembly then is a terrific one! But still an interpreter."
"Single ASM instructions should be considered non-atomic until proven otherwise, especially on x86 and other CISCy architectures, since an instruction is broken down into micro-ops, betwixt which you might have a context switch.  Atomic insns like compare-and-swap disable interrupts to elide this."

"Single assembly language instructions are non-atomic in multprocessor systems regardless of whether any of the processors does a context switch.  The way to obtain atomicity is to use operations that are specially designed for it, such as compare-and-swap, or lock, or Dekker's algorithm."
It looks like your implementation assumes that sizeof(uint32_t) == sizeof(float). Will that always be true for your target platforms? Will that always be true for your compilers?
@eyelidlessness: Are you serious? What a pain in the ass that will be.  What is wrong with IE8's DOM? The javascript caching issue?
I guess the only way to fix this is with IFRAMEs? yuck!  IE6 must just paint that form control directly over everything
"that's what i said, but got voted down :( I guess the problem is that if the number has a really large prime factor (such as itself), then this method must loop all the way up to that number. In a lot of cases though, this method is quite efficient."
"Almost everything that's wrong with IE 7's DOM, which is everything that's wrong with IE 6's DOM. Which is huge swaths of the spec, including everything from an incorrect implementation of Range to a complete absence of Mutation events to a completely broken event system itself."

"I would imagine BMH doesn't want to use this in every file, but to have a single location that details the current version of the system - look at the bottom right of this page for an example."
jQuery doesn't touch Range and cannot (without lots of overhead or requiring you to use only jQuery DOM manipulation methods) simulate Mutation events; it abstracts the event model except it still can't support event capturing. There are other problems but those have been my biggest headaches really
Hey that's pretty common in C# code as well.
So what do these IE shortcomings mean to me as a developer? I'm sorry I'm not as knowledgeable about Javascript. You seem to know your stuff!
"Oh, I forgot this one. At least through IE 7, Trident doesn't maintain its internal DOM structure as a tree, meaning you can actually end up with nonsense like a single DOM node spanning two adjacent parent nodes. You'd think innerHTML is the only way to do this, but it can happen with MSHTML too."
The Range problems make working with text selections (especially in richtext) infuriatingly painful. No Mutation events means polling for DOM changes is expensive even though the browser must do it internally and could expose it. The fallout of the event model isn't as huge but can cause problems.
"(This didn't fit in the last comment.) Basically, it makes using the web as a serious application platform really difficult."

"Apparently there are no rogue MS employees, only XUL. Wait, that's the wrong line. I asked Chris Wilson (I think in the link I posted above) why they wouldn't simply embed Webkit in standards mode, and he informed me that this would break ActiveX (cont'd)..."

"And to answer your question, Gecko 1.9 (FF3) and at least the current release of Webkit support (most of) those events. Presto doesn't. But the point is that the engine *must* internally handle the events as specified, or reflow/redraw with CSS/DOM manipulation would never work."
"Actually, the compiler won't let you instantiate TestImplementType<object>.  The type System.Object does not implement InterfaceBase."
Do you mean clockwise around the origin?
haha. Sounds like Microsoft! I didn't have any issues until I became a web developer with Microsoft. Oh well. Who knows they might make a last minute implementation.
"Just to be clear, the Chris Wilson I mentioned earlier, who pretty much admitted the DOM is getting the shaft in IE 8, is the ""Platform Architect of the Internet Explorer Platform team at Microsoft"" (from his about page)."
Not necessarily.
"A variable adds no garbage; there is no additional heap allocation for the ""s"" scenario. Re-using the indexer might, however, since the .ToString() will probably result in a different string object (unless the item was already a string)."
Using the name would also make it slower; a balancing act.
They should do what Google did... throw away Trident and incorporate Gecko and as you said use the ActiveX Plugin. And they can make their stupid little GUI. And everyone would be happy :)
Do you want to concatenate corresponding elements of each list? Or do you want the cartesian product of the lists?
Sorry that was meant to be Webkit. But Gecko would work equally as good.

"Oops, hadn't seen the constraint. However, the root point is sound - typeof(T) isn't the same as obj.GetType(). You could certainly write TestImplementType<InterfaceBase>(new ImplementA()). Furthermore, this example doesn't cope with classes derived from ImplementA."

I've added an edit in my answer to explain why this might be happening. I'll look more carefully in a while (45 mins). Note that doing concatenation in the append calls reduces the point of using StringBuilder in the first place somewhat :)
"Also it would be interesting to see what happens if you reverse the two blocks - the JIT is still ""warming up"" StringBuilder during the first test. It may well be irrelevant, but interesting to try."

"@Epaga: Your benchmark says little about the performance improvement in the real app, where the time taken to do the StringBuilder allocation may be trivial compared with the rest of the loop. That's why context is important in benchmarking."
"@Epaga: It's still outside the loop itself. Yes, it doesn't pollute the outer scope, but it's an unnatural way to write the code for a performance improvement which hasn't been verified *in context*."
"it makes it a bit more available - i.e. hit ""."" and it appears, as opposed to having to know about SomeUtilityClass.Zip(...); it also fits quite nicely with the other extension methods for IEnumerable<T>, so I'm comfortable with it as an extension method."
"@Jon I understand, but I*m assuming that if his whole question is geared towards which one has a higher performance, that a 25-50% difference IS important and that that part of his code will be called many times."
Epaga's benchmark shows that clearing and re-using is a gain over instantiation at every pass.
"An alternative to the KeyValuePair is to take a Func<TLeft, TRight, TResult> of course."
Good that you like it ;-)
"Nice idea; two thoughs on the implementation, though. First he doesn't dispose the enumerators (mainly a problem for exceptions). But more importantly, re-using the array is risky: if I call .ToArray()/.ToList() on this, I'll have 30 references to *the same array*, and no way to get the early data."
peterchen: Why *wouldn't* you want to be able to use this n a LINQ query? :)
Also with 1024 for the constructor and increasing the append operations to perform roughly 1024 characters (less than 1024 so no additional allocation is required) is 5264ms reallocation vs. 13985ms instantiation.
"Or even better, put the whole thing in its own method. ;-) But I hear ya re: context."
Or it could be clockwise around bondary center.
I'm not after your salary but I just have to comment that we just finished a website rework that included no html changes what so ever. Only the css and text content were changed (text is loaded from a resource bundle)
"@cfeduke: Thanks. That's *very* interesting. Will look into that when I get to work. This has reached the point of being genuinely surprising. When I've worked out what's going on, I'll write a fuller answer :)"
"Single color transparent png's are supported though. I used that for a website with lots of 4 bit images and single color transparency, for they were usually smaller than their gif counterpart."
"@Jon - nice, I like that projection ;-p Let the caller worry about it..."
"@Epaga: Until he's measured it with his real code, we'll have no clue how significant it really is. If there's a lot of code for each iteration of the loop, I strongly suspect it'll still be irrelevant. We don't know what's in the ""..."""
"Yeah initially, I was trying to do this in the datacontext class and saw that I had no access to it. I moved this logic out of the model and into the controller."
Better yet initialize with the expected size instead of sum arbitrary number (4096)  Your code may return a String that references a char[] of size 4096 (depends on the JDK; as far as I remember that was the case for 1.4 )
I'd want to see it run with the OP's production data.  Does he/she have 200 appends?  Are the strings really big?  How does this impact the benchmark?
Wow. 5264 vs 13985 IS surprising.
I'm sure we have all done something similar :D Best lessons are learned the hardest and all that. :)
"To me, clockwise order for a convex polygon means that you only make right hand turns when traversing the points. The origin should not matter."
"(Don't get me wrong, btw - your benchmark results are still very interesting in themselves. I'm fascinated by microbenchmarks. I just don't like bending my code out of shape before performing real-life tests as well.)"
how do you do that in IIS6?
